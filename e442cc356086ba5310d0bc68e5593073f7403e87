      "message": "in cases like this i usually say \"let me see your whole plan, so i believe the direction is attainable; otherwise this is just noise\".\n\nthough tbh, i\u0027m not sure i see the current situation as a bug. like i\u0027ve said before, \"the binary\" is the one thing we know people have. we\u0027re inherently never going to solve the \"the web doesn\u0027t accurately describe _my_ binary\" situation and (even though that\u0027s not a trivial problem to solve for --help either) --help is as good as we\u0027re going to get.\n\ni know you love man pages, but we\u0027re not building a .deb, and even if we were, what about macOS/Windows, where most of our users are?\n\nto me the wider project here still seems like a bad idea.\n\n(i think there\u0027s an _alternative_ argument here of \"--help and --version are two different things\". gnu tools generally agree [though i would point you at `tar --help` in reference to what i\u0027ve just been talking about], busybox/toybox consistently disagree [by virtue of \"one true main()\"], tools in between vary. even if we were starting again, i\u0027d say that one was hard to call. but given that we\u0027re not, i think it\u0027s pretty hard to defend changing the status quo here.)",
