      "message": "now we know that memset should not be used with non POD data structures.\n\nI see that there are a number memset usages across adb codebase. \nAlthough they might not trigger an immediate failure, but we should just rely on a default constructor for non-POD and maybe even POD types.\n\nSo I propose to revisit other memset cases and fix if needed.\nThere are 2 fix options:\n *. add the following type assert right before memset is performed:\n      static_assert(std::is_standard_layout\u003cstructT\u003e::value);\n      \n *. use in-place default constructor: new(ptr) structT;\n \n \n For example block struct in http://cs/h/googleplex-android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/adb/types_test.cpp?l\u003d33 contains unique_ptr that should be initialised via constructor and not memeset. We have to fix it as well.",

      "message": "Great point (I already looked for similar instances and fortunately didn\u0027t find any other fragility - yet :) \nOur particular case has to do with a combination of 1.) a memset() (it can be any other operations such as memcmp(), memcpy(), etc) that relies on a (flawed) offset computation PLUS 2.) the existence of a (non-virtual) struct (which happens to afford C++ default construction that correctly handles POD types) hierarchy.\nIn the case of other memset() usages (at least, the ones I looked over so far), the usage is safe IMO.\nThat said, I like your input about some sort of compile-time asserts - currently I have some vague ideas about adding a test module that can run on-device (e.g adbd_test) and will establish some ground truths based on the arch (getprop ro.product.cpu.abi) and POD type - pl stay tuned for a followup CL.",
