      "message": "now we know that memset should not be used with non POD data structures.\n\nI see that there are a number memset usages across adb codebase. \nAlthough they might not trigger an immediate failure, but we should just rely on a default constructor for non-POD and maybe even POD types.\n\nSo I propose to revisit other memset cases and fix if needed.\nThere are 2 fix options:\n *. add the following type assert right before memset is performed:\n      static_assert(std::is_standard_layout\u003cstructT\u003e::value);\n      \n *. use in-place default constructor: new(ptr) structT;\n \n \n For example block struct in http://cs/h/googleplex-android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/adb/types_test.cpp?l\u003d33 contains unique_ptr that should be initialised via constructor and not memeset. We have to fix it as well.",
