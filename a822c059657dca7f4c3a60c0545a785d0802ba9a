I don\u0027t remember why I didn\u0027t get around to switching the default, other than Windows being a problem (but I think it no longer is, now that everything older than Windows 10 is EOL).\n\nLooking at git history, I guess reimplementing the libusb client implementation in terms of the nonblocking API was one of the last things I did before leaving Google, so maybe I didn\u0027t want to launch and abandon it :-)",
