      "message": "Sidenote: I\u0027m not sure I understand the reasoning behind switching only OS X and not Linux to libusb. I don\u0027t remember why I didn\u0027t get around to switching the default, other than Windows being a problem (but I think it no longer is, now that everything older than Windows 10 is EOL).\n\nLooking at git history, I guess reimplementing the libusb client implementation in terms of the nonblocking API was one of the last things I did before leaving Google, so maybe I didn\u0027t want to launch and abandon it :-)",

      "message": "Most of the problems (around usb transport) are reported from OSX (and Windows at a lesser scale). However, so far we feel this feature has not been used widely (yet), since I can\u0027t recall a single bug originating from the libusb run (on any platform). Switching to libusb default is the first step towards getting some much-needed exposure (esp on MacOS where we have some unresolved issues in the legacy poll implementation). Windows would be the next target (this would be more complex since there\u0027s an associated need to get rid of the dependency on the wrapper library). The test infrastructure failures (on linux) are due to extraneous issues (flaky tests, MH) IMO, however if there\u0027s a convincing reason to switch to libusb as the default for linux that can be a consideration (glad to chat more offline).",

      "message": "Well, yeah, linux is still a tiny percentage of the user base. The linux and mac libusb implementations should be identical (except for that hack to sleep for a bit to wait for the device node to become appropriately chowned/chmodded) because we\u0027re not linking against udev), so deleting the usb linux implementation in favor of a single unified linux/mac(/windows?) implementation is a compelling reason to switch linux over as well.\n\nThere are way more mac users than linux users (and linux users are going to more likely to read the documentation and understand how to set an environment variable): if libusb is good enough to inflict on all of your mac users, it ought to be good enough to set as the default for linux as well.",
