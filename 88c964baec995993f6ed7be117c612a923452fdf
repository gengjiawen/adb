      "message": "I feel that the original author\u0027s intent was that it was human-readable in the sense that it is decipherable (like in a debugger) without symbolization. In other words, a pure binary (an executable, or a shared library or DLL) cannot yield much useful information to a developer (e.g decorated names of functions) VS ADB protocol is entirely in binary format that can be 100% converted to text that literally tells you all you need to know (all you need is to pass it into the handy-dandy adb function).\nSo, can you please consider keeping around the \u0027human-readable\u0027 aspect? (ok with clarifying that it is *also* a binary form).",

      "message": "I **AM** the original author. I have a pretty good idea of the intent. `human-readable` means human can read and understand it. That is what `text-protobuf` is. The protocol buffer stream of bytes issued by `track-app` is not readable or understandable or decipherable by a human.\n\nI have no idea what you mean with the suggestion to rephrase by keeping both `human-readable` and `binary`. You seem to have a better idea of how this should be documented, I will abandon this CL so you can take care of it.",
