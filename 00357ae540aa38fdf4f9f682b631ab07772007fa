From what I can see in the discussion, the biggest pain point is backwards compatibility and the general consensus is that it\u0027s too much work to ensure that other scripts/apps won\u0027t break.\n\nI personally think that implementing one of the solutions such as https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/160478861#comment10 is a good way forward given that the issue has been open since 2020.\n\nShould I try to implement this, or should I abandon the contribution (at least temporarily) until a \"correct\" way to proceed has been decided?",

As enh mentioned, I would like to see more elaboration on what problem we are trying to solve. \n\nYes, this is annoying that we are not in `~/.config` but besides being cleaner, not a lot of people have complained about it and I am concerned about the risk/reward ratio here, particularly when it comes to breaking people who were happy in the first place.",
