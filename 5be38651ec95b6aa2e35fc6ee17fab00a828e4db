(and stuff like \"gtests won\u0027t collide because they\u0027ll be in nativetest vs nativetest64\" doesn\u0027t apply for the host.)",

      "message": "You don\u0027t need these for libraries.  Libraries default to `compile_multilib: \"both\"`, binaries default to `compile_multilib: \"first\"`.  Static libraries aren\u0027t installed anywhere, so the suffix is unused.  Shared libraries are installed to `lib` for 32-bit and `lib64` for 64-bit, so the suffix is unnecessary.  The suffix is only needed for binaries, where both the 32-bit and 64-bit version are both installed to `bin` and would collide.  Tests _shouldn\u0027t_ need the suffix, but setting it may work around some problems.  I think `per_testcase_directory: true` should work for tests, and is the better solution if it works.",
