      "message": "don\u0027t write this kind of error messages --- this is a classic 1990s-era Windows of bad message[1], where you\u0027re _guessing_ something rather than _checking_ something. this is one reason why i suggested the alternative \"check for the directory and don\u0027t even call libusb_init() if it\u0027s not there\", since to provide a decent error here (given that libusb_init() seems to just return \"unknown failure\", judging by what we\u0027ve seen on the bug), we end up needing to do that anyway...\n\ni\u0027m also unconvinced that we want to ignore _all_ libusb failures?\n\n____\n1. at their worst, MS would list _multiple_ things. but anything in an error that\u0027s just a guess is bad, especially when it\u0027s something that the computer can check more easily than a human.",
