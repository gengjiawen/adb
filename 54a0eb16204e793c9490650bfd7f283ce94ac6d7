      "message": "i think this is just checkin comment habit to be getting into... don\u0027t link somewhere else, say something standalone --- use the typical git style where the first line is \"what exactly did i do?\" and the paragraph that follows is \"why did i do this?\".\n\n\"followup\" means nothing. this should presumably be \"Remove duplication.\" instead. (and that would be a special case where you can skip any later paragraphs because removing duplication doesn\u0027t need any extra justification :-) i guess \"Clean up style of $SHA.\" would have been fine too, but \"Remove duplication.\" is still better by the original rule --- \"clean up style\" just leaves you with the question \"what was wrong with the style?\", so we may as well go straight to the _answer_.)\n\ndon\u0027t make your reader think.\n\ndon\u0027t make your reader have to look stuff up.\n\ntrue for docs, true for code comments, true for checkin comments :-)",
