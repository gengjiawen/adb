      "message": "\u003e again, we need more notification than this, especially to take an extra dependency.\n\nUnderstood, I\u0027ve amended the commit message with more details about my use-case and the problem I\u0027m solving here.\n\n\u003e a bigger question for us is: why would a linux _host_ be running adbd (as opposed to the client or server), and why should we support that configuration?\n\nThis is actually about running adbd on a linux _device_ (the current real-world use-case being a project by an automotive OEM) and being able to manage it through USB. Linux _hosts_ don\u0027t need adbd indeed; if someone wanted to use it anyway, they should do so over the network and wouldn\u0027t even need this patch.\n\nHowever, for embedded systems running a non-Android Linux system, this can be useful as it helps automating the whole process of creating and activating the USB gadget configuration, as I mentioned in the (updated) commit message.",

The use case you describes features none. I suppose there are other ways/libs to configure USB gadget devices.\n\nMoreover, it is not a big CL but you have to factor in the resources necessary to maintain such a feature which would require special setup and testing.",
