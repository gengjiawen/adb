      "message": "This supports running multiple parallel adb servers (possibly different versions) on Linux. (maybe mac in the future, but not likely)\n\nUsers use go/si-device-cloud to check out a device and use that device. We also proxy adb connections from the user\u0027s workstation to the remote host running thte adb server. Currently, when they check out a device and run adb devices, they very often get multiple devices in the list that don\u0027t belong to them (because we have several devices per host). This causes significant confusion.\n\nAlso, I really dislike the attach feature as implemented because most users/tools aren\u0027t familiar with adb attach and don\u0027t know they need to re-attach after every device reboot.\n\nI would argue that is doesn\u0027t lie to callers, but that it gives you exactly what you asked for when you set ADB_LIBUSB_FILTER before launching the server. What if adb devices is modified to print out a message indicating that the set of devices is limited to usb device addresses \u0027x,y,z\u0027 because of ADB_LIBUSB_FILTER is set. This is similar to the way ADB_VENDOR_KEYS outputs a troubleshooting message.\n\nIf you prefer, the attach feature could be modified to \n\n1) always reattach after device reboot\n2) support a list of USB device ids to auto attach (so no one ever has to call attach)\n3) another environment variable to control whether adb devices shows the entire list, or is filtered to attached devices\n\nor\n\n1) I could just remove the attach feature and we go with this one?",

      "message": "Device Cloud is meant to be capable of doing almost any kind of device access you could do locally. Users could use it to test new recovery packages, new bootloaders, new versions of adb, and new Android Builds, and new builds of LK.\n\nDevice hosts in device cloud usually have more than one Android device connected.\n\nSince different, parallel versions of adb are supported, we need different instances. Buggy versions of adb could hang or crash, and reduce the overall stability of tests.  Finally, and most importantly, many developers will run adb kill-server without thinking about it and interfere with other peoples\u0027 tests.\n\n\u003e or we could add a new \"filtered\" state to the `adb devices` display... that way parsers of `adb devices` output fail more gracefully too.\n\nThis is still confusing to users. They check out one device, they expect to see on device on adb devices. We are constantly explaining this to people. Your suggestion is an improvement, not a full fix.\n\n\u003e have you talked to the \"other internal engprods\" (android and google3) about this? because #1 does sound like something they would all have encountered\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/google.com/g/si-device-cloud-team/c/yF5_hIrO7yk/m/_t_KA2AnBAAJ?utm_medium\u003demail\u0026utm_source\u003dfooter\u0026pli\u003d1\n\nBack in the day, mobile ninjas wrote adb turbo to solve this and other issues I believe.\n\n\u003e  i\u0027m curious what other engprod groups are doing in that regard\n\nI would be surprised if anyone is using the feature as implemented.

The auto-kill adb server on version mismatch is hostile. This aspect of adb has always really bothered me.",
