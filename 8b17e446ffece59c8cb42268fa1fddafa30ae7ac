(\"what can i do with what you\u0027ve just told me?\")\n\nif you learned about features elsewhere, but didn\u0027t know how to query them from the command line, is the better fix to mention `adb features` there?",

      "message": "I gave some thought about including the URL in the binary and I don\u0027t think this is a good idea to include it in `--help`. Once the binary ships, this is set in stone. And I am pretty sure this URL will somehow become obsolete. Either someone will move it or someone will make us move it because of architecture/build/whatever reasons. From the git history, `adb` has moved location several times already.\n\nI would prefer that we write a man page so good that it becomes the #1 result on Google search when you query `adb man` or `adb manual`.\n\nQuestion 1/ Which other project has improved \"discoverability elsewhere in the system\" via URL? And how has this URL resisted the assault of time (are they still 200 or 404)?\n\nQuestion 2/ You comment seems to indicate you don\u0027t want the doc in the command-line output but I often want to be able to see it here. Today I ran `adb --help | grep features` because I knew the command but could not remember the difference with `host-features`. There is value in having it in command-line and value in having it in the `.md`. \n\nIf the concern is to declutter the command-line output, I have a long term plan on breaking commands down in units. Once executed, users will have to type `adb features --help` to get syntax help and `adb --help` will only return a line per category followed on the same line by the accepted commands. This should relax their jaw :) !",
