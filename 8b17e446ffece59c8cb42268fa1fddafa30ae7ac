      "message": "this one maybe really should just go straight into one of the .md files? there\u0027s no explanation of what a \"feature\" is, what the set of features are, what any given feature name means? i\u0027m not sure what\u0027s here is actually useful without that? (\"what can i do with what you\u0027ve just told me?\")\n\nif you learned about features elsewhere, but didn\u0027t know how to query them from the command line, is the better fix to mention `adb features` there?",

      "message": "Putting it in a md and explain `features` at length is definitely something I want to do.\n\nBut how high will this md rank when they google \"adb documentation\" or \"adb command-line\", we have no idea. Whereas putting it in here in guaranteed to be seen.\n\nI agree that `features` may not be that useful to most users but this `-help` section is so bad that I don\u0027t even bother using it anymore. Resorting to finding out what adb CLI can do by reading the source code is not acceptable.",
