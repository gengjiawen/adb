      "message": "libbase logging is the preferred logging, D() is just a wrapper around that, and so we should probably be moving in the direct direction (which may actually be `VLOG(USB)` here, now you\u0027ve made me look more closely) instead of more use of D()?\n\nas for \"which of these logs should be which severity of logging?\", i have no idea.\n\nmy comment about installing a custom logger was meant as a pointer to the general solution to the \"i want _all_ the logging in my trace file\", which i don\u0027t think anything else can solve?",
