We could change connect_device to spawn a thread internally and return its result via future (or a pollable fd? It might be worth doing this so that we can connect to multiple mdns devices at once instead of going through them serially?)",

      "message": "I agree, implementing it in connect_device is better.\n\nAs for the current serial implementation, I was worried about the case where there are many auto-connectable devices available at once. If we go with the thread approach, we could be spawning a lot of threads at once. WDYT jmgao?",
