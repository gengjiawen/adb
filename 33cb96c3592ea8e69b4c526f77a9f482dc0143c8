      "message": "Instead of doing this for just mdns, can we do it for all tcp connections? We could change connect_device to spawn a thread internally and return its result via future (or a pollable fd? It might be worth doing this so that we can connect to multiple mdns devices at once instead of going through them serially?)",

      "message": "I agree, implementing it in connect_device is better.\n\nAs for the current serial implementation, I was worried about the case where there are many auto-connectable devices available at once. If we go with the thread approach, we could be spawning a lot of threads at once. WDYT jmgao?",

      "message": "Yeah, if we\u0027re expecting to connect to a hundred devices at a time, then spawning a thread for each might not be a great idea.\n\nLooking at the callers of connect_device, there\u0027s one in services.cpp that\u0027s already on its own thread, and then the two mdns ones. I think the easiest thing to do would be to just move your thread up one layer and have it serve all connect_devices instead of just mdns requests, and have connect_device return a future so that the connect service can block on it.",
