      "message": "I will hold off this patch as I found it\u0027s not that straight forward to add adbd as a system binary. I somehow installed it with m adbd \u0026\u0026 m, and it turns out it\u0027s not the proper way to install system binary per https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/g/soong-discuss/c/TRsDxzqR-QU/m/b-sfUvTIBAAJ. Then I tried to install it by adding adbd to PRODUCT_PACKAGE, but the build failed because stub libraries like libadb_pairing_connection can only exist either in platform or in apex but not both (context: b/277651159). I need more time to figure out the right solution, please feel free to leave comments and suggestions.",
