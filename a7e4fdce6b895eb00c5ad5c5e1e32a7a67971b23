      "message": "i think we can _fix_ this test, in one of two different ways (both of which might be worthwhile).\n\n1. the test just wants to see if we can set a property and read the value back. it doesn\u0027t care what that property is. although you need root to set _arbitrary_ properties, the `debug.*` space is settable by non-root.\n\n2. _why_ can\u0027t you use @requires_root here? _what_ in go/2022-hide-root-signals causes that? (and, again: non-googlers can\u0027t follow that link, so any comment [code or commit] should mention the one pertinent fact, not rely on an inaccessible doc.) and what does that mean for @requires_root generally? are other uses of @requires_root affected? can you fix @requires_root?",
