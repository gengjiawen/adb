Linux and Windows default to the adb implementation, macOS defaults to libusb. To override the default for your OS, set ADB_LIBUSB to \"1\" to enable libusb or \"0\" to enable the adb implementation.\"\n\n(and don\u0027t include the `export` example --- the others don\u0027t, and if we think that\u0027s useful, it should be factored out rather than repeated for every single variable.)\n\ni\u0027m a bit dubious about saying what OS defaults to what ... this is one of the fundamental issues with having docs outside the binary. is there a way to ask the binary what it\u0027s using? does it show up in `adb --version` or anything?",
