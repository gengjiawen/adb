# NAME

**adb** â€” CLI Client for ADB (Android Debug Bridge) Server. 


# SYNOPSIS

**adb** [*GLOBAL_OPTIONS*] command [*COMMAND_OPTIONS*]


# DESCRIPTION

Connects to the ADB Server via its smart socket interface. Allows to send requests, receive responses, and manage lifecycle.

Tasks are performed via commands. Some commands are fulfilled directly by the server while others are forwarded toward the ADBD (ADB Daemon) running on the device.

# GLOBAL OPTIONS:

**-a**
: Listen on all network interfaces, not just localhost

**-d**
: Use USB device (error if multiple devices connected)

**-e**
: Use TCP/IP device (error if multiple TCP/IP devices available)

**-s *SERIAL***
: Use device with given serial (overrides $ANDROID_SERIAL)

**-t *ID***
: Use device with given transport id

**-H**
: Name of adb server host [default=localhost]

**-P**
: Port of adb server [default=5037]

**-L *SOCKET***
: Listen on given socket for adb server [default=tcp:localhost:5037]

**\-\-one-device *SERIAL*|*USB***
: Server will only connect to one USB device, specified by a serial number or USB device address (only with 'start-server' or 'server nodaemon').

**\-\-exit-on-write-error**
: Exit if stdout is closed


# GENERAL COMMANDS:

      will automatically reboot the device.

 reboot [bootloader|recovery|sideload|sideload-auto-reboot]
