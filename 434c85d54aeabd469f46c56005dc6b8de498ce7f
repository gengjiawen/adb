Work around this in the adb client by\n    running a mkdir on all of the directories we would have otherwise\n    created.\n    \n!   On devices where we perform the workaround, this coincidentally fixes\n!   a historic bug where we failed to push empty directories.\n    \n    Bug: http://b/25566053\n    Bug: http://b/110953234\n    Test: python test_device.py\n    Change-Id: I690ec356c206fed4e5ab2c681c5570c8b231e26b\n```\n...without this now-unused variable being removed. so this seems safe to remove (see the lines marked with \u0027!\u0027), rather than pointing to a bug because we should be using this variable.",
