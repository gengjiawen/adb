      "message": "\u003e is there a reason this is opt-in rather than opt-out?\n\nIt\u0027s easier to reason with when it\u0027s opt-in. We don\u0027t want to compress non-updatable apex, bootstrap apex, non-module apex and test apex. So there are plenty of apex which would need to be opt-out too. I would say both are cumbersome.\n\nBy opting-in, we found that it is easier to verify side effects from compression. For example, when we compressed art-apex, it broke few builds cause art-apex runs some tests during build time to check its internal structure. Test failed since art was suddenly compressed.\n\nJust today, I merged a cl to compress extservice and it broke a tv build due to artifact error. Conscrypt is also failing pre-submit due to some test failure during build time. It\u0027s easier to fix these issues when we are dealing with them one at a time.\n\n\u003e and there\u0027s no useful information in the code comment explaining why this apex is opted in\n\nSorry about that. I have updated the commit message with more explanation.",
