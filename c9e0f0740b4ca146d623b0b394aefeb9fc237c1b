      "message": "for example: this is only called from a function that explicitly sets and clears the thread id on entry and exit. this should never be called without a valid looper.\n\ni think the high-level idea here with these assertions is to try to make the lifecycle more explicit (as well as checked), so these exceptions weaken that. which functions can _legitimately_ be called without a looper?",

      "message": "the asymmetry here is especially odd --- why does the member function require the *caller* to check, but the free function is *callee*-checked? again, that makes it harder for the reader to reason about what any of these assertions mean. (tbh, i\u0027d be tempted to not have *both* kinds of function for exactly that reason.)",
