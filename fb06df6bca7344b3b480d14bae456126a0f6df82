      "message": "The origin of the bug (`wait-for-disconnect` is a no-op for tcp/wifi device) is because there is_a transport but t-\u003eGetUsbHandle() appears not to be a good enough discriminator for when to return from wait_service(). By using the is_ambiguous flag, I feel that we can reliably distinguish the transports (including tcp/ip), and will force the user to supply the required information (to wait for). I have also updated the tests to include regression.\nPS: Apologies for the confusion around IsTcpDevice() - it was likely an error-prone run (hadn\u0027t run `adb kill-server` which likely caused some inconsistency).",
