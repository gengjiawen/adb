      "message": "i think we\u0027re all agreed on \"not actually a man page\" already. and \"adb.1.md\" is fine --- the web browser will do the work, and we\u0027ll still have a README.md that acts as a signpost to the different docs, at least until/unless we end up with One True Doc that has everything (which seems unlikely; sooner or later every doc gets big enough that you want to split it into pieces).\n\nif we\u0027re worried about that already, we can just go straight to a docs/ directory with a README.md serving as index. (but once we put a URL in the `adb --help` output, we\u0027re pretty much stuck with it. and note that gittiles _doesn\u0027t_ support symlinks to .md files in the way you\u0027d want; that\u0027s why bionic has most of its documentation in a docs/ directory, but one file outside of there that we can\u0027t move without breaking references on the internet.)\n\n(so if your point was actually just \"we should call the directory `man`\", yeah, +1 :-) )",
