      "message": "yeah, agree that \u0027in-process\u0027 isn\u0027t right, but i do think this is a great place to introduce client + server + daemon. either that, or \"don\u0027t talk about an implementation detail in the first sentence\" and just go with something more user-focused like \"adb lets you interact with Android devices over USB or TCP/IP\", because the whole client/server/daemon thing probably warrants a whole section to itself...\n\n(don\u0027t worry, i\u0027m not asking you [or anyone!] to write any specific section. i\u0027m even happy to +2 empty \"TODO\" sections tbh. it\u0027s times like this that make me wish we had a more docs/wiki kind of alternative to hand... something more collaborative for the \"let\u0027s just get everything down\" phase. but i think the key is just to have _a_ doc started, so whenever we have something that\u0027s not yet documented anywhere, we have somewhere to put it!)",
